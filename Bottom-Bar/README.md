# Bottom Bar
This was a small project to get a text and call on the bottom of a mobile screen. Theres a list of phone numbers in an array that will be chosen at random and will take the text or call button.

I have plans to turn this into a WP plugin and it will have the ability to add/edit/remove number.

You can see it in action on your mobile device here: https://www.nivrealestate.com/
